#Method 2: ILOC[] method
# Remove all columns between column index 1 to 3  Note: The removal will affect the original dataset

#Method 3: IX[] method
# Remove all columns between a specific column name to another column name Note: The removal will affect the original dataset

#Method 4: LOC[] method
# Remove all columns between a specific column name to another column name Note: The removal will affect the original dataset
